## sunset-hue (otherwise you can call me sunset)

- your average programmer
- VERY much a procrastinator so expect 6 month gaps between commits on some projects
- learning C (for the 3rd time) hopefully I don't just leave it in the dust this time
- python programmer that makes pretty unreadable code (i'm sorry people who're about to contribute to inkcord ðŸ˜­)
